Shroom
======

Accumulator game where you farm mushrooms

# Game Loops

## House

You start with a house that is just one room. You can expand onto your house with:

*	Workshop
	Craft tools, weapons, and armor

*	Kitchen
	Craft potions and magic(?)

*	Lab
	Research upgrades, recipes, schematics
    
You can upgrade those rooms as well, and hire people to work in them, increasing your production speed. Eventually you could have a bustling castle filled with rooms and employees.

You pay for all these upgrades with shrooms... 

## Farming

Surrounding your house at the beginning of the game is a small plot of land. You can farm mushrooms there (which just means clicking the ground initially). Soon your plot is full and you can't farm any more quickly than you already are. You must either buy upgrades, or explore. 

### Upgrades
In the long term, upgrades are how to get a lot of shrooms. You first hire farm hands, then invest in combine harvestors, fertilizer, etc.

Short term, upgrading becomes too expensive to be feasible at some point really early, forcing...

## Exploring

To get more land (which multiplies your production capacity), you have to explore, and clear the wilderness.

The World Map is randomly generated at the start of the game, and all tiles except the home tile and adjacent tiles are hidden. 

Tiles adjacent to tiles that have been explored are visible, but not explored.

To explore a tile, you have to enter it (click it), which most of the time means fighting your way through a dungeon.

### Tile Types

*	Wilderness
	Wilderness gets more and more difficult the farther from the home tile you 			travel. Maybe it'll go like: scrublands, forest, jungle, desert, swamp,    
*	Cave
*	Fortress
*	Special tiles that are points of interest

### Dungeons

Dungeons work the same as candybox, in that you can try them without penalty, and you win them by getting to the end. If you lose, you get nothing. If you win, you get whatever you found in the dungeon.

## Crafting

To explore more dangerous wilderness, you have to craft items. 

### Potions
*	Healing
*	Defense
*	Offense

Recipes are a series of steps you follow to create the potions. Each step is either:

*	Add a certain ingredient
*	Bring to a certain temperature
*	Perform a certain action (eg. mix, bake, sautee, boil, fry, etc))

#### Tools

To craft potions you'll need tools like:
*	bowl, cauldron, pot, pan
*	mixing spoon, ladel
*	fire, oven, stove

#### Ingredients

* 	shrooms
* 	shroom oil
* 	truffles

### Tools / Weapons / Armor
*	cooking equipment
*	weapons
* 	armor

Crafting system is similar to cooking, with schematics that instruct you to:

*	Add a certain ingredient
*	bring to a certain temperature
*	perform a certain action (assemble, pound, hammer, pressurize, etc)
